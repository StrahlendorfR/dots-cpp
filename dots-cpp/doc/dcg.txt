Dots Code Generator

Current:
- create 3 files for a struct and 2 for an enum.
- name of created file-names has to match with the source-filename


Changes:
- add list of templates for type via a config-file, this enables to create as many
  files from a source file

- create destination-files from struct- or enum-name
- parse more than one struct or enum per file, allowing to make complete model-files


Config-File:
- Specify templates for types
- Filename-creation rule

struct = (<template-name>, <template-name>, ...)

Filename is created using <struct/enum-name>.<templ-extension>

Eg.
struct MyTestStruct {}
Template: "struct-templ.dots.h"
Output filename: "MyTestStruct.dots.h"
